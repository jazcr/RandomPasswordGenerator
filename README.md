## PASSWORD GENERATOR

(Generator box currently not working)
This is a tool that generates a random password for you. You must choose between 8 and 128 characters and you must select at least one of the criteria that are prompted in "pop-up" boxes.

After choosing the length and desired criteria, a randomly generated password will appear in the box.
